# 🎄 Advent of Code 🎄

My own solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.  —Eric Wastl
